EfficientNet models is a family of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) designed by Google AI to achieve high performance with fewer computational resources.

Here's a breakdown of the key points:

Why EfficientNet?
- Traditional methods for scaling CNNs involve increasing width, depth, or resolution independently.
- EfficientNet proposes a more balanced approach called compound scaling, which uniformly scales all three dimensions.
- This results in models with fewer parameters yet achieving better accuracy compared to previous architectures.

Commonalities Across EfficientNet Models (B0-B7):
- All models share a similar stem (initial layers) and final layers.
- Each model consists of 7 main blocks, further containing a varying number of sub-blocks.
- Five basic modules are used to construct these sub-blocks.

Understanding Model Differences:
- The number of sub-blocks increases as we move from EfficientNet-B0 to B7.
- The main difference between B0-B3 and B4-B7 lies in the number of feature maps (channels), impacting the number of parameters.
